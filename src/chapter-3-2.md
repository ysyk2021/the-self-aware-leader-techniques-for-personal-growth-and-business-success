Chapter 2: Assessing Your Leadership Style: Self-assessment tools to determine your leadership style
====================================================================================================

As a leader, it's important to understand your own leadership style and how it affects your team. By being self-aware of your strengths and weaknesses, you can become a more effective leader and achieve greater business success.

In this chapter, we will explore various self-assessment tools that can help you determine your leadership style. These tools are designed to give you insight into your personality traits, communication styles, decision-making processes, and more.

Personality Tests
-----------------

Personality tests can provide valuable insights into your leadership style. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is one such test that can help you identify your personality type. The MBTI measures four dichotomies: extroversion/introversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling, and judging/perceiving. Based on your responses, the test assigns you a four-letter code, which represents your personality type.

Another popular personality test is the Big Five Personality Traits. This test measures five broad dimensions of personality: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. By understanding your personality traits, you can better understand your leadership style and how you interact with others.

Communication Style Assessment
------------------------------

Effective communication is essential for successful leadership. The DISC assessment is a tool that can help you understand your communication style. The assessment measures four behavioral styles: dominance, influence, steadiness, and conscientiousness. By identifying your dominant communication style, you can adjust your communication approach to better connect with your team.

Emotional Intelligence Assessment
---------------------------------

Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions in oneself and others. Leaders with high EI are better able to build relationships, motivate their team, and communicate effectively. The EQ-i 2.0 assessment is a tool that can help you assess your emotional intelligence. The assessment measures five composite scales: self-perception, self-expression, interpersonal, decision-making, and stress management.

Decision-Making Assessment
--------------------------

Leaders are often faced with difficult decisions that can impact their team and the business as a whole. The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI) is a tool that can help you identify your preferred style of conflict resolution. The assessment measures five different conflict-handling styles: competing, collaborating, compromising, avoiding, and accommodating. By understanding your preferred style, you can make more effective decisions and resolve conflicts in a way that benefits everyone involved.

Conclusion
----------

Assessing your leadership style is an essential step towards personal growth and business success. By using self-assessment tools like personality tests, communication style assessments, emotional intelligence assessments, and decision-making assessments, you can gain valuable insights into your strengths and weaknesses as a leader. Armed with this knowledge, you can adjust your approach to better connect with your team and achieve your goals.
